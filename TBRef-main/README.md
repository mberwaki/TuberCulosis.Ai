# TBRef.ai
TBRef.ai is a computer vision program that aims to expedite the process for a pulmunology referral, while providing data for pulmonologists to learn from. Clients are able to upload a 'TBRef' and recieve immediate feedback on what our AI believes the condition is, and request a pulmunologist referral. The TBRef is also anonymized and can be used for educational puposes in medical schools or at conferences. This provides a sustainable ecosystem for obtaining retraining data.
